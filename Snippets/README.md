To use these snippets, open your Eclipse and find the Snippets view (if you can't see it, go to menu path Window->Show View->Other and search for Snippets or find it under the General tab.)  Once opened, right click anywhere in the Snippets view and choose Customise...

From here, you should have an Import option - use this and navigate to the snippets.xml file you should have downloaded locally.
